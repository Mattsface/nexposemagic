Nexpose Magic is a project created by Matthew Spah to help Nexpose Admins pull information from their consoles on the command line.

It is currently in alpha stage and should only be used for testing purposes.

Required files:
 nexpose-magic.rb
 config.yml

config.yml holds the console login information and should be used with extreme care. I'll implement a better solution when I figure out how.


To display information about a specific scan engine:
	- nexmagic.rb -e [--engine] <engine ID>

To display nexpose site information:
	- nexmagic.rb -t [--site] <site ID>

To display scans that are currently running on your nexpose console:
	- nexmagic.rb -v [--vscans]

To display a table list of either all sites or engines present on a console:
	- nexmagic.rb -l [--list] <scans | engines>

To display command line help:
	- nexmagic.rb -h
